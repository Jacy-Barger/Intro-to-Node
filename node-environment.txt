1. What is npm and what does it do?

	NPM is a package manager.  It facilitates and simplifies the installation of software, tools and packages, to be used in an application.  Package managers like npm are essential in downloading, installing, and updating the various software tools developers need to create their apps.  Without package managers, it would fall on the developer to find each tool, package, and library that would be needed for an application. 


2. What kind of information does package.json hold?

	Package.json stores key/value pairs in the format of a json file.  It holds descriptive information such as the name of the folder, a description of the app, and the main file type.  It also holds the various dependencies that will be added as the app is developed.  



3. Google another Node package. Using the demo directory run npm install <theNameOfThePackage> --save. Check the contents of your package.json file to make sure that the dependencies list the name of the Node package.

	I installed GRUNT version 1.0.4, and I've pasted my package.json contents below.

	
{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "grunt": "^1.0.4"
  }
}
